# Python-api-challenge

WeatherPy

- Use Citipy library to generate list of over 500 random cities
- Iterate through list of cities and gather information regarding weather patterns in each city
- Information gathered with Open Weather API and JSON traversals
- Using previously gained skills with creating dataframes (Pandas) and graphing (Matplotlib) weather patterns were displayed graphically to show trends relating to a city's latitude. 
- Individual graphs were created using a function, able to automatically plot regression, determine correlation and annotate with line of best fit equation. 

VacationPy

- Google maps (gmaps- jupyter notebook) used to plot a map including each of the cities, using humidity as the weight factor for the heatmap layer
- Using previously acquared data from cities, 'ideal' locations for vacations were selected with given conditions.
- Gmaps API was traversed again using the places search, to find hotels within 5000m of these ideal locations
- A final map was contructed on top of the previous map, displaying pins of the hotels.
